%\section{Introduction}

\section{Proposal}
To optimize the cuts for the search for a Z' at the LHC focusing on the dielectron channel, we will consider psuedo-data generated by Pythia+Delphes for the analysis. The number of
events will be determined by the integrated luminosity. We will consider LHC8 with 20.3 $fb^{-1}$, with the intention of extending to LHC13 with varying
amounts of integrated luminosities.

The model for the Z' that will be used for this study will be the Sequential Standard Model Z'. With the intention of extending the optimization of the cuts to 
also include otehr Z' models, such as E6 and Left-Right Symmetric Model.

With the data that we obtain, we will pass it through both a Boosted Decision Tree and a Neural Network to optimize the cuts to 
seperate the background from the signal. We will also use the current cuts for the Z' search to analysis the current effectiveness
of these cuts. The cuts on the data that we will consider are: $p_t$ of the leptons, invariant mass cuts, rapidity cuts of the leptons, and photon isolation.

The background to our process includes the SM Drell-Yan, $t\bar{t}$, diboson production, and QCD. We will start with only considering the largest
of these backgrounds in our analysis (SM Drell-Yan), and adding the other processes in later, since the effects of these should be small.
These processes will also be generated through Pythia+Delphes, again with the number 
of events generated corresponding to the integrated luminosity.
